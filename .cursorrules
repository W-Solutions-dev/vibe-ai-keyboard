# Speech-to-Text Keyboard Project Guidelines

## Project Overview
A local, privacy-focused speech-to-text system that acts like a USB keyboard, with optional voice command support. All processing happens locally using OpenAI's Whisper model.

## Core Principles
1. **Privacy First**: All processing must be local, no cloud services
2. **Security by Default**: Commands disabled by default, whitelist approach
3. **User Control**: Clear visual/audio feedback, easy toggle on/off
4. **Accessibility**: Works system-wide in any application

## Code Style Guidelines

### Python
- Use Python 3.8+ features
- Follow PEP 8 with 100 character line limit
- Type hints for function parameters and returns
- Docstrings for all classes and public methods
- Use f-strings for formatting

### Logging
- Always use the logging module, never print() for debugging
- Log levels: DEBUG (verbose), INFO (standard), WARNING (issues), ERROR (failures)
- Include context in log messages
- Separate setup.log and runtime.log files

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation - never crash the entire system
- Catch specific exceptions, not bare except
- Log errors with full context
- Provide user-friendly error messages

## Architecture Patterns

### Security Model
```python
# Always use whitelist approach for commands
SAFE_COMMANDS = {
    "command_name": command_function,
}

# Block dangerous patterns explicitly
BLOCKED_PATTERNS = [
    r"pattern_regex",
]
```

### Audio Processing
- Use Voice Activity Detection (VAD) before processing
- Buffer audio until silence detected
- Process in separate thread to avoid blocking
- Queue-based communication between threads

### Configuration
- Use argparse for CLI options
- Environment variables for system paths
- JSON/YAML for complex configuration
- Sensible defaults for all options

```

## Development Workflow

### Adding New Features
1. Create feature branch
2. Update relevant documentation
3. Add tests in test_setup.py
4. Implement with logging
5. Test with test_helper.sh
6. Update QUICKSTART.md if needed

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Audio device detection works
- [ ] Microphone captures audio
- [ ] Whisper model loads
- [ ] Text is typed correctly
- [ ] Commands execute safely (if enabled)
- [ ] F9 toggle works
- [ ] Clean shutdown on Ctrl+C

### Common Issues & Solutions
- **ALSA warnings**: Normal on Linux, can be suppressed
- **High CPU**: Use smaller model or GPU acceleration
- **No audio**: Check permissions and device selection
- **Import errors**: Verify virtual environment activation

## Voice Command Guidelines

### Adding New Commands
1. Add to SAFE_COMMANDS dictionary only
2. Test for security implications
3. Log command execution
4. Provide feedback to user
5. Handle errors gracefully

### Command Naming
- Use natural language: "new line" not "newline"
- Support variations: "press enter" and "new line"
- Avoid technical jargon
- Keep commands short and clear

## Performance Optimization

### Model Selection
- tiny: Fast, less accurate, good for testing
- base: Default, balanced performance
- small/medium: Better accuracy, higher resource use
- large: Best accuracy, requires GPU

### Resource Management
- Stream audio processing
- Release resources on pause
- Use appropriate chunk sizes
- Consider battery usage on laptops

## Security Considerations

### Never Allow
- System commands (shutdown, reboot)
- Privilege escalation (sudo, admin)
- Window management (Alt+F4)
- Script execution
- File system access

### Always Require
- Explicit user activation (F9)
- Visual confirmation of actions
- Logging of all commands
- Whitelist validation

## Future Development Areas

### High Priority
1. Visual UI control with screenshots
2. Text-to-speech feedback
3. Enhanced logging system
4. GPU acceleration support

### Medium Priority
1. Multi-language support improvements
2. Custom wake words
3. Profile management
4. Cloud model integration (optional)

### Low Priority
1. Mobile app companion
2. Web interface
3. Plugin system
4. Voice training

## Git Commit Guidelines
- Prefix: feat:, fix:, docs:, test:, refactor:
- Present tense: "Add feature" not "Added feature"
- Reference issues when applicable
- Keep commits atomic and focused

## Documentation Standards
- Update README.md for major features
- Keep QUICKSTART.md concise
- Include code examples
- Document security implications
- Add inline comments for complex logic
