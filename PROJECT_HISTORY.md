# Project Development History

## The Journey of Vibe AI Keyboard

This document chronicles the collaborative development journey between human creativity and AI assistance in creating the Speech-to-Text Keyboard project. Through approximately 500 Claude Opus requests, we've built a powerful, privacy-focused tool that brings voice input to any application.

## Development Timeline

### Initial Vision
**Human Request**: "I want to setup a local speech to text listener/converter for linux such taht it acts like a USB keyboard. so it's a global listener when enabled, and whatever i say is converted to text and TYPED automatically wherever the cursor in on my machine. for example I can be looking at my email client and i just press a hotkey to enable/disable listening, and when I speak it types directly into the email, or in a google docs document, a bash terminal etc. i don't want to use any cloud solutions"

**AI Response**: Created the foundational architecture using:
- OpenAI's Whisper model for local speech recognition
- PyAudio for audio capture
- pynput for keyboard simulation
- Voice Activity Detection (VAD) for automatic speech detection

### Core Features Development

#### 1. Basic Speech-to-Text Implementation
- **Feature**: Core functionality with Whisper model integration
- **Components**: Audio capture, VAD, keyboard typing simulation
- **Hotkey**: F9 to toggle listening on/off

#### 2. Security-First Design
- **Human Concern**: Security and safety of voice commands
- **AI Implementation**: 
  - Whitelist approach for commands
  - Commands disabled by default
  - Comprehensive blocking of dangerous operations
  - Separate versions (text-only vs commands)

#### 3. Setup Infrastructure
- **Feature**: Idempotent setup script
- **Improvements**:
  - State tracking with `.setup_state`
  - Detailed logging to `setup.log`
  - Component verification
  - Resume capability

#### 4. Testing Framework
- **Components**:
  - `test_setup.py` for component verification
  - `test_helper.sh` for interactive testing
  - Comprehensive error checking

### Major Improvements

#### False Detection Filtering (User Feedback)
**Problem**: "the program is detecting breathing, keyboard sounds, or typing random text like 'thank you'"

**Solution**:
- Increased VAD aggressiveness to level 3
- Energy-based filtering with noise floor calibration
- Extended false positive list
- Minimum speech duration requirements
- Created enhanced version with advanced filtering

#### First Words Cut-Off Issue (v0.2.0)
**Problem**: "the first words are cut off and not detected"

**Solution**:
- Implemented pre-buffer system (450ms)
- Instant speech detection (reduced from 3 to 1 chunk)
- Configuration file support
- Created `test_prebuffer.py` visualization tool

#### Configuration System
- **File**: `speech_config.json`
- **Features**:
  - All parameters externalized
  - Easy tuning without code changes
  - Sensible defaults
  - Dynamic loading

### Thank You

To the human collaborator: Your vision, patience, and excellent feedback have made this project possible. The ~500 requests represent not just code, but a journey of iterative improvement and shared creativity. Here's to many more features and improvements ahead! ðŸš€

Edit by the "human": This is just great, this has been a journey to vibe code my way around and look how far it has enabled us to go by simply managing existing knowledge, with the prereq that you have some field knowledge yourself. Great job whoever you are buddy!

## January 6, 2025 - Keyboard Typing Interference Fix

### User Request
"keyboard doesnt seem to behave as the main app"

**User Context**: User noticed that when using the commands version, typed text appeared fragmented with logging messages interrupting the output (e.g., "H[log message]ello" instead of "Hello").

### Technical Analysis
- **Problem**: Console logging was interfering with keyboard typing
- **Cause**: Log messages were being output immediately after typing began
- **Impact**: Text appeared fragmented and difficult to read

### Solution Implemented
- Added delay after typing to ensure completion before logging
- Changed console output to use carriage returns for cleaner display
- Modified output format to show typing status without disrupting typed text

### Technical Details
- Small 50ms delay added after keyboard.type() calls
- Console output changed from `\n` to `\r` for status updates
- New format: `[Typing: text]` instead of inline interruptions

### Result
Clean, uninterrupted text output that matches the behavior of the main application.

## January 6, 2025 - Core Logic Unification

### User Request
"I need the lite and commands and enhanced to share the same logic as the main one as thats the one you worked on but you've not updated the others?"

**User Context**: User noticed that improvements were made to the main version but other versions were missing these features.

### Technical Analysis
- **Main version**: Had all features (config, pre-buffer, filtering, calibration)
- **Commands version**: Missing config support, pre-buffer, filtering, duplicate detection
- **Enhanced version**: Missing pre-buffer system
- **Lite version**: Missing most core features

### Solution Implemented

#### Commands Version Updates:
- Added configuration file support
- Implemented pre-buffer system for complete speech capture
- Added false positive filtering from config
- Added energy-based filtering with noise calibration
- Implemented duplicate detection (2-second threshold)
- Fixed console output interference
- Removed automatic trailing space

#### Enhanced Version Updates:
- Added pre-buffer system
- Updated configuration defaults

#### Lite Version Updates:
- Added configuration file support (with lite-specific defaults)
- Implemented pre-buffer system (smaller buffer for performance)
- Added false positive filtering
- Kept it simpler (no VAD or calibration) to maintain "lite" nature

### Result
All versions now share the same core logic and features from the main version, ensuring consistent behavior and performance across the entire project.
