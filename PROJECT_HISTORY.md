# Project Development History

## The Journey of Vibe AI Keyboard

This document chronicles the collaborative development journey between human creativity and AI assistance in creating the Speech-to-Text Keyboard project. Through approximately 1000 Claude Opus requests, we've built a powerful, privacy-focused tool that brings voice input to any application.

## Development Timeline

### Initial Vision
**Human Request**: "I want to setup a local speech to text listener/converter for linux such taht it acts like a USB keyboard. so it's a global listener when enabled, and whatever i say is converted to text and TYPED automatically wherever the cursor in on my machine. for example I can be looking at my email client and i just press a hotkey to enable/disable listening, and when I speak it types directly into the email, or in a google docs document, a bash terminal etc. i don't want to use any cloud solutions"

**AI Response**: Created the foundational architecture using:
- OpenAI's Whisper model for local speech recognition
- PyAudio for audio capture
- pynput for keyboard simulation
- Voice Activity Detection (VAD) for automatic speech detection

### Core Features Development

#### 1. Basic Speech-to-Text Implementation
- **Feature**: Core functionality with Whisper model integration
- **Components**: Audio capture, VAD, keyboard typing simulation
- **Hotkey**: F9 to toggle listening on/off

#### 2. Security-First Design
- **Human Concern**: Security and safety of voice commands
- **AI Implementation**: 
  - Whitelist approach for commands
  - Commands disabled by default
  - Comprehensive blocking of dangerous operations

## 1 Jun 2025 - Keyboard Typing Interference Fix

### User Request
"keyboard doesnt seem to behave as the main app"

**User Context**: User noticed that when using the commands version, typed text appeared fragmented with logging messages interrupting the output (e.g., "H[log message]ello" instead of "Hello").

### Technical Analysis
- **Problem**: Console logging was interfering with keyboard typing
- **Cause**: Log messages were being output immediately after typing began
- **Impact**: Text appeared fragmented and difficult to read

### Solution Implemented
- Added delay after typing to ensure completion before logging
- Changed console output to use carriage returns for cleaner display
- Modified output format to show typing status without disrupting typed text

### Technical Details
- Small 50ms delay added after keyboard.type() calls
- Console output changed from `\n` to `\r` for status updates
- New format: `[Typing: text]` instead of inline interruptions

### Result
Clean, uninterrupted text output that matches the behavior of the main application.

## 1 Jun 2025 - Core Logic Unification

### User Request
"I need the lite and commands and enhanced to share the same logic as the main one as thats the one you worked on but you've not updated the others?"

**User Context**: User noticed that improvements were made to the main version but other versions were missing these features.

### Technical Analysis
- **Main version**: Had all features (config, pre-buffer, filtering, calibration)
- **Commands version**: Missing config support, pre-buffer, filtering, duplicate detection
- **Enhanced version**: Missing pre-buffer system
- **Lite version**: Missing most core features

### Solution Implemented

#### Commands Version Updates:
- Added configuration file support
- Implemented pre-buffer system for complete speech capture
- Added false positive filtering from config
- Added energy-based filtering with noise calibration
- Implemented duplicate detection (2-second threshold)
- Fixed console output interference
- Removed automatic trailing space

#### Enhanced Version Updates:
- Added pre-buffer system
- Updated configuration defaults

#### Lite Version Updates:
- Added configuration file support (with lite-specific defaults)
- Implemented pre-buffer system (smaller buffer for performance)
- Added false positive filtering
- Kept it simpler (no VAD or calibration) to maintain "lite" nature

### Result
All versions now share the same core logic and features from the main version, ensuring consistent behavior and performance across the entire project.

## 1 Jun 2025 - Code Synchronization Rule Added

### User Request
"add a cursor rule that all changes to any file need to reflect to others if applicable in this regard as well."

**User Context**: After unifying the core logic across all versions, user wanted to ensure future changes would maintain this consistency.

### Solution Implemented
Added comprehensive rule to `.cursorrules` that mandates:
- Checking if changes apply to other versions
- Updating all applicable versions to maintain consistency
- Clear delineation of shared vs version-specific features
- Requirement to run test script after cross-version changes

### Impact
This ensures that future improvements, bug fixes, and features are properly propagated across all versions, preventing the divergence that necessitated the earlier unification effort.

## 1 Jun 2025 - False Positives Configuration Refinement

### User Request
"why are all those words in the false positives i need to be able to use those i guess or at least yeah yues no okay ok alright etc not uh um hmm"

**User Context**: User noticed that the false positives list was too aggressive, blocking common words that should be typed like "yes", "no", "okay", etc.

### Technical Analysis
- **Problem**: False positives list included useful words that users would want to type
- **Impact**: Words like "yes", "no", "okay", "ok", "alright", "yeah" were being filtered out
- **Root Cause**: Over-correction from earlier false detection issues

### Solution Implemented
Refined the false positives list to only include:
- **Filler words**: "uh", "um", "hmm", "ah", "oh"
- **Empty/punctuation**: "", ".", "!", "?"
- **Known false detections**: "Thanks for watching!", specific garbled patterns

Removed from false positives:
- All common words: "yes", "no", "yeah", "okay", "ok", "alright"
- Useful words: "the", "you", "thank you", "thanks"

### Result
System now only filters actual noise and filler words while allowing all normal conversational words to be typed.

### Lesson Learned
When filtering false positives, be conservative - it's better to occasionally get noise than to block legitimate words the user wants to type.

## 1 Jun 2025 - Multilingual Support Implementation

### User Request
"can we use multiple langs at once like en and nl?"

**User Context**: User wanted to know if the system could handle multiple languages, specifically English and Dutch, potentially switching between them while speaking.

### Technical Analysis
- Whisper supports 100+ languages natively
- Can auto-detect language when `language` parameter is `None`
- Supports seamless switching between languages within the same session

### Solution Implemented
1. **Configuration Update**: Changed default `language` from `"en"` to `null` for auto-detection
2. **Example Config**: Created `speech_config_multilang.json` with Dutch filler words added
3. **Documentation**: Added comprehensive multilingual section to QUICKSTART.md

### Technical Details
```json
"whisper": {
    "language": null,  // Auto-detect any language
    // Alternative: "nl" for Dutch only, "en" for English only
}
```

### Features
- Auto-detection of 100+ languages
- Seamless switching between languages mid-sentence
- Language-specific filler word filtering
- Works with all model sizes (larger models better for non-English)

### Result
Users can now speak in any supported language or mix languages freely, with Whisper automatically detecting and transcribing in the appropriate language.

## 1 Jun 2025 - Automated Issue Resolution Capability
